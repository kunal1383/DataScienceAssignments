    "#### Q1. Is it permissible to use several import statements to import the same module? What would the goal be? Can you think of a situation where it would be beneficial ?\n",
    "**Ans:** Yes, it is permissible to use several import statements to import the same module in Python. The goal might be to make the code more readable and modular, avoiding long import statements. It can be beneficial when different parts of the code require access to different functions or attributes of the same module."

    "**Ans:** TSome characteristics of a module in Python are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A module is a file containing Python definitions and statements.\n",
    "2. It is a way to organize code and promote code reusability.\n",
    "3. It can define functions, classes, and variables that can be accessed by other parts of the program using import."

    "#### Q3. Circular importing, such as when two modules import each other, can lead to dependencies and bugs that aren't visible. How can you go about creating a program that avoids mutual importing?\n",
    "**Ans:** To avoid circular importing, you can restructure the modules or use import statements selectively within functions or blocks of code instead of at the module level. Another approach is to move the common functionality to a separate module that both modules can import without circular dependencies."

    "#### Q5. In what situation is it useful to refer to the `__name__` attribute or the string `__main_ _` ?\n",
    "**Ans:** Referring to the __name__ attribute or the string '__main__' is useful to determine if a Python script is being run as the main program or if it is being imported as a module into another script. By using if __name__ == '__main__':, you can specify code that should only execute when the script is run directly and not when it is imported."

    "\n",
    "* Tracking the execution progress of the interpreter.\n",
    "* Allowing debugging and error handling by identifying the line or instruction causing issues.\n",

    "\n",
    "* Stack data structure: For storing and managing operands and intermediate results.\n",
    "* Arithmetic and logical operations: Basic operators for addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and comparisons.\n",
