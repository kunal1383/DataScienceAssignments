    "#### Q1. Explain the difference between greedy and non-greedy syntax with visual terms in as few words as possible. What is the bare minimum effort required to transform a greedy pattern into a non-greedy one? What characters or characters can you introduce or change?\n",
    "**Ans:**  Greedy syntax matches as much as possible, while non-greedy (lazy) syntax matches as little as possible. To transform a greedy pattern into a non-greedy one, add a question mark (?) after the quantifier (e.g., *?, +?, ??)."
