    "#### 1. How do you distinguish between shutil.copy() and shutil.copytree()?\n",
    "**Ans:**\n",
    "* `shutil.copy(src, dst)`  function is used to copy a single file from the source (src) to the destination (dst) location. It creates a new file at the destination with the same content as the source file. If the destination file already exists, it will be overwritten.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `shutil.copytree()`function is used to recursively copy an entire directory tree from the source (src) to the destination (dst) location. It creates a new directory at the destination and copies all files and subdirectories from the source directory to the destination directory. If the destination directory already exists, it will raise an error.\n"

    "#### 2. What function is used to rename files??\n",
    "**Ans:** `os.rename()` function is used to rename files or directories using a python program, this function takes two arguments `src` and `dest`, `src` represents the name file/directory which we want to rename, whereas `dest` represents the new name of the file/directory."

    "#### 3. What is the difference between the delete functions in the send2trash and shutil modules?\n",
    "**Ans:** \n",
    "* The send2trash module is used to send files or directories to the system trash or recycle bin instead of permanently deleting them. It provides a safer alternative to the os.remove() function, as it allows for the possibility of recovering the deleted files if needed. The `send2trash.send2trash()` function takes a file or directory path as an argument and moves it to the trash or recycle bin.\n",
    "\n",
    "* On the other hand, the shutil module provides `shutil.rmtree()` function which is used to remove an entire directory tree, including all its files and subdirectories. This function permanently deletes the specified directory and its contents "

    "#### 4.ZipFile objects have a close() method just like File objects’ close() method. What ZipFile method is equivalent to File objects’ open() method?\n",
    "**Ans:** The equivalent method in the ZipFile class to File objects' open() method is the ZipFile() constructor. `zipfile.ZipFile('filename', mode = 'r')`"
